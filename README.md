# Telegram Bot with Python
This repo is linked to a [presentation](https://slides.com/palaxx/telegrambot) on slides.com.

The goal of this lab is to introduce a programmer, without experience on python and telegram, on bot's
developments. 
I will use this repo and presentation for an internal lab for the company I'm working for. 

I'm not an expertise bot developer, so could the *guru* excuses me in case of mistakes. 

This repo is diveded into some incremental levels, from 0 to 5. 
I prefer to create a initial *requirements.txt* instead add record based on the current level, 
so the first thing you have to do is install all the dependencies. 

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

After that you can start with Level 0

```bash
git checkout level0
```
